 * rather than queueing it for the next tick, for the same "a Send click
 * takes effect right away, whatever the Simulation Clock's play/pause/step
 * state" reason. `droneId` switches to `'investigatingFire'` `fireId`
 * starting now, carrying the given `missionKind` (which of `FirePanel`'s
 * two lists — Bingo Range or One-Way Mission — the Drone was sent from;
 * `FirePanel` itself decides this via `bingoRange.ts`'s
 * `classifyFireDispatch`, not this function, since classification depends
 * on live telemetry this pure state-transition has no need to recompute).
 *
 * Issue V: dispatch *is* the instant orbiting begins in this engine (no
 * separate travel-time phase — mirrors `withManualDispatch`'s own
 * immediate-hover/circle convention), so this function does the same two
 * things {@link fireWithOrbitStarted}/`positionForActivity` would do on
 * the very next `advanceSimulation` tick, just immediately: (1) snapshots
 * the Fire's real current orbit radius (`growthEllipse.ts`'s
 * `fireOrbitRadiusMetersAt`, using `state.wind`) into the new
 * `'investigatingFire'` activity's `orbitRadiusMeters` — fixed for this
 * whole investigation, per that field's own doc comment — and re-derives
 * the Drone's position onto that orbit circle via `orbitPositionFor`
 * (replacing `withManualDispatch`'s hover/circle-at-the-target math: both
 * Drone types orbit a Fire, neither hovers); (2) ratchets the Fire itself
 * straight to `'investigated'` with its first Confirmed Shape snapshot
 * (`fireWithOrbitStarted`), so the map reflects "this Fire is now being
 * orbited" the instant "Send" is clicked, not one tick later. Unlike
 * `'investigating'`, there is still no fixed-duration expiry to hand off
 * to here — `activityAfterInvestigationExpiry` gives a `'roundTrip'`
 * mission a one-orbit-lap ending and deliberately leaves `'oneWay'` sticky
 * until issue W's endurance-exhaustion ending. A no-op (returns `state`
 * unchanged, same object identity) if `droneId` isn't currently
 * `'patrolling'` or `fireId` isn't a currently-non-`'undetected'` Fire
 * (i.e. at least Tower-Detected, so it has an open, clickable `FirePanel`
 * to send from) — `FirePanel` only ever offers "Send" for an eligible
